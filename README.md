# bodily sensations of joyful work

<p><b><i>Critical Inquiry: Straining the Letters into Noise, Direct and Undetectable, Speech</b></i> gathers us, students at Virginia Commonwealth University’s Graphic Design Department, to read texts, write, discuss, and look deeply inside of our communities and ourselves. It gives us the opportunity to bring a voice to our thoughts and speak them to one another. Reading texts such as <u>Decolonizing Non-Violent Communication</u> by meenadchi, <u>Mutual Aid: Building Solidarity Within This Crisis (And The Next)</u> by Dean Spade, <u>Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom</u> by bell hooks, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s2heYTUtNCCPdDZZtInLyfjO-lImnbmZ2l_CWsCrGEU/edit?usp=sharing" style="color:#bc1df1;">others</a>, we have learned new ways to process and express our thoughts. This publication is an amalgamation of digital and printed work that we created during our time in class and shares all that we have learned.</p>

<p>Our collaborative introduction, <i>Bodily Sensations of Joyful Work</i>, is a manifesto we created that is inspired by <i>Workaholics Anonymous’s “Working Joyfully"</i> chart that appears in <u>Mutual Aid</u>, and the list of <i>Body Sensations</i> that appears in <u>Decolonizing Non-Violent Communication.</u></p>

<p>Thank you for being here!</p>
